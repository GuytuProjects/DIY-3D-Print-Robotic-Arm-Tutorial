# Step #1: Lets Get Started!
  This is the first step towards building your robotic arm.

## Make Your Blueprint
 > **Challenge:** Make your own Block Diagram and Wiring Schematic for
  your Robotic Arm to help you get a better understanding of how wiring works
  and the thought process that goes into doing similar things. As I said in the introduction I highly recommend you do this challenge as a way to learn in the best way possible.

## Print Your Parts
  To truly start the process of building your own robotic arm you need the things that every engineering project needs. In our case, you will need to 3d print a bulk of arm parts that you will later put together to make the final product. Also, you will not be printing all the parts that you see in the attached link so  please review the list of parts needed and download.
