# Step #1: Lets Get Started!
  This is the first step towards building your robotic arm.

## Make Your Blueprint
 > **Challenge:** Make your own Block Diagram and Wiring Schematic for
  your Robotic Arm to help you get a better understanding of how wiring works
  the thought process that goes into doing similar things.
For those of you thinking of doing the Challenge, good for you, but for those who are thinking of skipping the challenge and just copying my block diagram and wiring schematic I highly urge you not to do so if you want to learn anything.
