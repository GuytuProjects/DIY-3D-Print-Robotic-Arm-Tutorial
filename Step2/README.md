# Writing the Code!
This is the second section of the robotic arm tutorial what we have done is the starting steps of the project: creating a blueprint and printing the parts needed to build the arm. Now what we are going to do in this section is create our own code which we are going to use to make the robotic arm function.

## Before We Start
Before we start some of you who are following this tutorial may have a different function for you, unfortunately, I will not cover any other functions so you will have to figure out the code yourself, but feel free to use my code as a template. For those who are exactly following this tutorial please do not just copy the code there are two ways that I recommend that you proceed with this course: 
  1. Try to make your own code as there are multiple ways to solve one problem
  2. It is okay to copy my code but while doing so please try to understand why I wrote what I wrote
