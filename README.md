# DIY 3D Print Robotic Arm Tutorial
This is a step by step how to tutorial for creating 3d printed robotic arm that outputs 1,2,3,4,and 0(Fist) fingers(edit this to make this better)

## The Results!

## Introduction
  This tutorial is to help people who are interested in creating a robotic for fun or for an educational opportunity.
  Regardless of the factor that is motivating you to follow this tutorial I implore you not to follow the steps mindlessly
  or just copy the code, instead please try to make sense of my instructions and try do things in your own way. Lets get started!

  __*Note: Some of these materials may not be needed for you it all depends on the situation you are in.
  for the materials that I marked (may not be needed), I am not using them, but you might, so before beginning
  this project please research if you need those materials or not and make the appropriate decision. Also if you want to
  see the price for the material press the link attached to the section header.__

## Other Resources
  While going through this tutorial there may be times where you don't understand what is happening and just done't 
  know what to do. That is fully understandable as I cannot encapture everything that you want in this tutorial. So to address
  that problem these are two resources/tutorials on building exact same arm(keep in mind that the functions of the arms in these 
  tutorials are different than the function of this tutorial that you are following). Here are the tutorials:
