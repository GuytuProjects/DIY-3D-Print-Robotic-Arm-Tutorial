# DIY 3D Print Robotic Arm Tutorial(Working Title)
This is a step by step educational how to tutorial to help people get started in the world of engineering with a simple but cool project that is easy to do and cheap to build. The project is a robotic arm that takes a command inputted by the user into a PC and outputs a 1, 2, 3, 4, or first(0) gesture.

## The Results!

## Introduction
  Throughout this tutorial, there will be challenge prompts and self-reflection prompts that are there for you to answer while you are in the process of building your very own robotic arm. I advise you that you answer these           questions to the best of your ability as it is the best way to learn the material that you will be working with. Also regardless of the factor that is motivating you to follow this tutorial, I implore you not to follow the steps    mindlessly or just copy the code, instead please try to make sense of my instructions and try to do things in your way. Let's get started!

## [List of Materials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dp6b8R32gZZG6dd2im-lXMtWr-UyI8ejz0LY45OnSRQ/edit?usp=sharing)
Here are the list of materials that you will need for building the robotic arm:
  1. DC - DC Converter(May not be needed)
  2. Fishing Wire(or any form of string)
  3. Arduino UNO(1x)
  4. Breadboard Jumper Wires
  5. MG-995 Servo Motors(5x)[put amazon link here]
  6. RS 232 Connector(May not be needed)
  7. Small Breadboard
  8. Resistors(Recommended 1k ohms)
  9. 3d Printer and Filament(Do not Buy)
  10. SuperGlue
  11. 3/32 Drill Bit
  12. Screwdriver and Screws/Bolts

  __*Note: Some of these materials may not be needed for you it all depends on the situation you are in.
  for the materials that I marked (may not be needed), I am not using them, but you might, so before beginning
  this project please research if you need those materials or not and make the appropriate decision. Also if you want to
  see the price for the material press the link attached to the section header.__

## Other Resources
  While going through this tutorial there may be times where you don't understand what is happening and just done't 
  know what to do. That is fully understandable as I cannot encapture everything that you want in this tutorial. So to address
  that problem these are two resources/tutorials on building exact same arm(keep in mind that the functions of the arms in these 
  tutorials are different than the function of this tutorial that you are following). Here are the tutorials:
