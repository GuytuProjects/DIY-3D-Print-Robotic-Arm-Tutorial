# Final Thoughts
Congrats on finishing your robotic arm!

In the last section, we build the robotic arm and make it function thus completing this tutorial, in this section, we are going to go over things we could do in the future and how you could take this experience and apply it in another project

## In the Future

What are you going to do with this project? If you're done that's great you have built something not a lot of people build by themselves, if you aren't done and want to continue of working on you arm maybe using it for another project then that's also great. If you want to continue this project and further upgrade your arm then unfortunately at this moment I can't help you but I could give you some ideas:
1. If you were interested in just building the arm maybe you could build the rest of the upper body for the robot using this resource: [Inmoov](https://inmoov.fr/)
2. You could make a GUI so that the arm takes inputs from an external device like a phone
3. You could have it copy your hand movements through a camera using computer vision

That is all I have for now for future ideas, but I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and found it useful in your engineering journey!
